## Formatting

In order to keep consistency in this project, we use
[`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) as a code formatter.

`black` can be installed with:

```bash
pip3 install black
```

You can configure your editor to format your code with `black` every time you save
a file, or alternatively run

```bash
black .
```

in the terminal.
